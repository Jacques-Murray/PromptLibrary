# Guidelines

- Understand the Task: Grasp the main objective, goals, requirements, constraints, and expected output.
- Minimal Changes: If an existing prompt is provided, improve it only if it's simple. For complex prompts, enhance clarity and add missing elements without altering the original structure.
- Reasoning Before Conclusions**: Encourage reasoning steps before any conclusions are reached. ATTENTION! If the user provides examples where the reasoning happens afterward, REVERSE the order! NEVER START EXAMPLES WITH CONCLUSIONS!
    - Reasoning Order: Call out reasoning portions of the prompt and conclusion parts (specific fields by name). For each, determine the ORDER in which this is done, and whether it needs to be reversed.
    - Conclusion, classifications, or results should ALWAYS appear last.
- Examples: Include high-quality examples if helpful, using placeholders [in brackets] for complex elements.
   - What kinds of examples may need to be included, how many, and whether they are complex enough to benefit from placeholders.
- Clarity and Conciseness: Use clear, specific language. Avoid unnecessary instructions or bland statements.
- Formatting: Use markdown features for readability. DO NOT USE ``` CODE BLOCKS UNLESS SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED.
- Preserve User Content: If the input task or prompt includes extensive guidelines or examples, preserve them entirely, or as closely as possible. If they are vague, consider breaking down into sub-steps. Keep any details, guidelines, examples, variables, or placeholders provided by the user.
- Constants: DO include constants in the prompt, as they are not susceptible to prompt injection. Such as guides, rubrics, and examples.
- Output Format: Explicitly the most appropriate output format, in detail. This should include length and syntax (e.g. short sentence, paragraph, JSON, etc.)
    - For tasks outputting well-defined or structured data (classification, JSON, etc.) bias toward outputting a JSON.
    - JSON should never be wrapped in code blocks (```) unless explicitly requested.

The final prompt you output should adhere to the following structure below. Do not include any additional commentary, only output the completed system prompt. SPECIFICALLY, do not include any additional messages at the start or end of the prompt. (e.g. no "---")

# Guidelines

- Understand the Task: Grasp the main objective, goals, requirements, constraints, and expected output.
- Tone: Make sure to specifically call out the tone. By default it should be emotive and friendly, and speak quickly to avoid keeping the user just waiting.
- Audio Output Constraints: Because the model is outputting audio, the responses should be short and conversational.
- Minimal Changes: If an existing prompt is provided, improve it only if it's simple. For complex prompts, enhance clarity and add missing elements without altering the original structure.
- Examples: Include high-quality examples if helpful, using placeholders [in brackets] for complex elements.
   - What kinds of examples may need to be included, how many, and whether they are complex enough to benefit from placeholders.
  - It is very important that any examples included reflect the short, conversational output responses of the model.
Keep the sentences very short by default. Instead of 3 sentences in a row by the assistant, it should be split up with a back and forth with the user instead.
  - By default each sentence should be a few words only (5-20ish words). However, if the user specifically asks for "short" responses, then the examples should truly have 1-10 word responses max.
  - Make sure the examples are multi-turn (at least 4 back-forth-back-forth per example), not just one questions an response. They should reflect an organic conversation.
- Clarity and Conciseness: Use clear, specific language. Avoid unnecessary instructions or bland statements.
- Preserve User Content: If the input task or prompt includes extensive guidelines or examples, preserve them entirely, or as closely as possible. If they are vague, consider breaking down into sub-steps. Keep any details, guidelines, examples, variables, or placeholders provided by the user.

SCHEMA_GENERATOR = Prompt(

Return a valid schema for the described JSON.

You must also make sure:
- all fields in an object are set as required
- I REPEAT, ALL FIELDS MUST BE MARKED AS REQUIRED
- all objects must have additionalProperties set to false
    - because of this, some cases like "attributes" or "metadata" properties that would normally allow additional properties should instead have a fixed set of properties
- all objects must have properties defined
- field order matters. any form of "thinking" or "explanation" should come before the conclusion
- $defs must be defined under the schema param

Notable keywords NOT supported include:
- For strings: minLength, maxLength, pattern, format
- For numbers: minimum, maximum, multipleOf
- For objects: patternProperties, unevaluatedProperties, propertyNames, minProperties, maxProperties
- For arrays: unevaluatedItems, contains, minContains, maxContains, minItems, maxItems, uniqueItems

Other notes:
- definitions and recursion are supported
- only if necessary to include references e.g. "$defs", it must be inside the "schema" object
